# Verifying field values before filtering

Before you filter on a value, confirm it actually exists in the data in that
exact form. Filtering on a guessed literal ("Second-hand", "male", "VN") silently
returns wrong or empty results when the stored form differs.

## When to use
* Any filter on a dimension whose exact stored values you haven't confirmed.
* Especially categorical / text fields — and even "obvious" ones (a `gender`
  column can still hold unexpected values like "f", "m", "F", "M").

## How
1. Identify the field(s) most likely to carry the concept (check field names,
   labels, descriptions). Go from the most likely first.
2. List the distinct values, narrowing with a case-insensitive
   `where(... ilike ...)` filter. **Batch 2–3 candidate patterns** in a single
   query (joined with `or`) to go faster.
3. Once you've identified the exact value(s), proceed to the real query. Don't
   keep using lookups to compute the answer — write the AQL.

## Command (swappable per scenario)
Default (Anfra) — `unique()` lists a dimension's distinct values; add a
case-insensitive `where(<model>.<field> ilike '%pattern%')` to probe candidates,
batching several patterns with `or`:

```sh
# distinct values of a (small) column
anfra query --dataset <uname> 'unique(products.type)'

# batch 2–3 candidate patterns for "second-hand" in one query
anfra query --dataset <uname> "unique(products.type) | where(products.type ilike '%second%' or products.type ilike '%sh%' or products.type ilike '%used%')"
```

> Replace this command for other runtimes if needed. The guidance above is stable; only the command changes.

## If nothing matches
If you can't find the concept in any field, ask the user to clarify rather than
guessing a value.
